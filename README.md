Overview
--------

The code in this replication package reproduces all results for Garcia, Heilmayr, Jordan, and Lee's regression discontinuity design analysis of Chile's Native Forest Law. 

Instructions for replication
---------------------------

- Set up compute environment: Open `init.R`. Adjust the path to the CONAF folder in your dropbox directory. This file generates a remote simulink to the external data.

- If you want to generate the data from the very beginning, start in `chile_discontinuity/data_prep/`. 

- If you want to replicate the main results, start in `chile_discontinuity/analysis`.
